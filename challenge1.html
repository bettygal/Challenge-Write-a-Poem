    <h1>Trust Issues</h1>
    <p>I'm not perfect and I don't claim to be <br> I have insecurities <br> I get jealous <br> I overthink everything <br> I have trust issues <br> Some days I don't think I'm good enough <br> That's who I am I'm not afraid to admit it <br> But 
        you know what? <br> I'm amazing in many ways too <br> I have a huge heart with lots of scars <br> A soul that's been through hell and back <br> Not everyday is my best <br> Some days I fuck up and make mistakes <br> But I learn from them <br>
        I want to grow and be the best version of myself <br> I'm a work in progress and some day I'll make someone proud to call me their's.</p>
